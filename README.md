I refactored the HTML & style.css by cutting out redundant aspects such as the same color and text for what could done be all in one class, and the same process for images.
I also would reactively adjust the style.css to match what i had just changed in the relative sections/divs in the html file.
Made sure to reduce the ammount of divs and using sections where applicable instead.
